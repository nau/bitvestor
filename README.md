## Prerequisites

- Bitfinex account with API keys generated, with permissions to create orders.
- USD Tether (USDT) balance on Bitfinex account.

## How it works

In Bitvestor Settings you can set the Bitfinex API keys, the amount of USDT per order, and the period of time between orders.
The bot will automatically create a market order for the amount of USDT you set, every time the period of time you set passes.

## Notice

The bot is only active when the browser is open and the extension is enabled.
The exact time of the order creation is not guaranteed. That should not be a problem though.
